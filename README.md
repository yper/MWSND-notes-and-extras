# MWSND notes and extras
**My Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree notes and extras.**

Being granted a scholarship for [Udacity's/Google's Mobile Web Specialist Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/mobile-web-specialist-nanodegree--nd024) (yay!), I needed a place to hold all my notes, resources, links, ideas and project works. This repository seemed to be a great choice in that matter and - as a nice side effect - it'll help me find my way around GitHub as well! 

Feel free to share your thoughts and insights :-)
